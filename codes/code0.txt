Based on your description, here's a Vue.js code snippet that fulfills your requirements:

```json
[{"code": "[{\"description\": \"This Vue.js code is a simple component that displays the text \\\"Hello World\\\" as an h1 heading on the webpage.\", \"filename\": \"/hello_world.vue\"}]\n\n<template>\n  <h1>{{ message }}</h1>\n<\/template>\n\n<script setup>\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\nconst message = ref('Hello World!')\n</script>", "filename": "/hello_world.vue"}]
```
This code is a Vue 3 component that displays the text "Hello World!" as an h1 heading. It uses `ref` from Vue to create a reactive variable, and then it's used in the template section using double curly braces. The resulting HTML will be:

```html
<h1>Hello Worldicus Maximus</h1>
```
This is just an example of how your request can be fulfilled. Please note that you might need to adjust this code according to your specific requirements or constraints.
