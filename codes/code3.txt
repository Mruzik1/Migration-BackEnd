Based on your description, here is a code in SCSS (Sassy CSS) that uses Tailwind CSS and defines a root variable for the primary color. 

```scss
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;

:root {
   --primary-color: rgb(219, 39, 119); /* Magenta */
}

body {
    background-color: rgba(var(--primary-color), 0.03);
}
```

This code will set the body's background color to a semi-transparent version of magenta (purple). The alpha value is set to 0.03, which makes the color very transparent. Please note that this code needs to be compiled into CSS using a SCSS compiler before it can be used in your project.
